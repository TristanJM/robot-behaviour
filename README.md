E-Puck robot programming for behaviour coursework

### Set Up
You can find the files under `program > demo`. Each coursework task has its own .c and .h file (prefixed as cwk_).
    1. Clone git repo
    2. Create your own branch
    3. Open the workspace: [program > demo > Coursework.mcw](/program/demo/Coursework.mcw)
    4. Use main_c.c and edit your task files (eg. cwk_fear.c and cwk_fear.h)
    5. Build the project
    6. Use Tiny Bootloader to load the [program > demo > Coursework.hex](/program/demo/Coursework.hex) file onto the E-Puck. (Be patient)
